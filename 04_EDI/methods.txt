We conducted a literature search based on three seminal papers establishing the ecological importance of ponds: Oertli et al. (2005), Sondergaard et al. (2005), and Downing (2010), each of which has >100 citations. We conducted a backwards and forwards search in April 2019 to compile all papers cited by these three papers, and all papers that cited them, yielding 519 unique papers. From these papers, 161 had data for individual ponds, from which we extracted physical, chemical, and biological data (n = 1798 waterbodies). Because this dataset of individual waterbodies included large and deep lakes, we subselected sites that were small (≤ 20 ha in surface area) and shallow (≤ 9 m in maximum or mean depth) resulting in 1327 waterbodies. To ensure consideration of all potential ponds, these cutoffs included waterbodies slightly greater than the maximum depth (8 m; Oertli et al. 2005) and maximum surface area (10 ha; Biggs et al. 2005, Oertli et al. 2009; Grinham et al. 2018; Kalff 2002) used to define ponds in several prior studies. We provide a .csv file including data from all 1327 ponds and citations for each pond along with a separate .csv file for all extracted latitudes and longitudes.  
In addition, we reviewed all 519 papers for pond definitions. We found 40 pond definitions where the authors explicitly referred to their study waterbodies as ponds (e.g., we excluded “shallow lakes” and “small lakes”). The definitions included 89 citations of 48 unique papers; we evaluated all cited papers that were not already in our compilation for additional definitions and citations. This process added 14 definitions, plus an additional five cited papers not assessed due to our inability to access or translate them. We provide a .csv file of all definitions with citations for those definition origins.
We examined policy definitions using the United States (US) state. For state policies, we sent electronic surveys to individuals working in state environmental agencies in all states. We asked whether their state defined lakes, ponds, and wetlands, and requested the legislative sources. We received responses from 42/50 states and evaluated all definitions provided and their associated legislation. We provide a .csv file of all definitions from all 50 states with results from the responding 42 states. For the 8 states that did not respond to our survey, we have ‘No response’ for each of the definitions.
