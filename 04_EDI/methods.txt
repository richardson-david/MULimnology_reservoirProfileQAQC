A Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) model 50B was used to take profiles prior to 2000, while model 85 was used between 2000 and 2006, and model 550A was used from 2006 to 2016. Prior to 2017, temperature (50B and 85: accuracy: ±0.1 °C, resolution: 0.1 °C; 550A: accuracy: ±0.2 °C, resolution: 0.1 °C) and dissolved oxygen (accuracy: ±0.3 mg L-1, resolution: 0.01 mg L-1) measurements were made at discrete, vertical depths (0.5 m intervals). After 2016, dissolved oxygen (optical sensor; accuracy: ±0.1 mg L-1, resolution: 0.01 mg L-1) and temperature (accuracy: ±0.01 °C, resolution: 0.001 °C) profiles were continuous and collected using a YSI EXO3.
