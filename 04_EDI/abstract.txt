This 45-year limnology dataset is from 250 reservoirs in the state of Missouri (MO) in the USA collected by the University of Missouri Limnology Lab. Physical parameters derived from sensors include temperature and oxygen with depth. Most of the profiles were collected during the summer months (May-September) when the reservoirs were thermally stratified, but a few were taken year-round. The majority of profiles were taken at the deepest point in the reservoir- directly in front of the dam. Sampling was conducted from a boat most of the time, but a few profiles were taken from bridges and docks. The bulk of the data come from the Statewide Lake Assessment Project (SLAP), funded by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.
