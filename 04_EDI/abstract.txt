This dataset of limnological profiles was collected from 250 reservoirs in Missouri (MO, USA) by the University of Missouri Limnology Lab beginning in 1989. Physical parameters derived from sensors include temperature and oxygen with depth. In 2017, sondes were upgraded to Yellow Springs Instruments (YSI) EXO3s; profiles include a range of physical, chemical, and biological parameters including depth, conductivity, pH, oxidative-reductive potential (ORP), chlorophyll a, phycocyanin (BGA), and turbidity. Most profiles were collected during summer (May-September) when the reservoirs were thermally stratified, with some collections during other seasons (October-April). Profiles were typically measured at the deepest point in the reservoir directly up-reservoir of the dam. Sampling was routinely conducted from a boat, but a few profiles were taken from bridges and docks. Data mainly come from the Statewide Lake Assessment Project (SLAP), funded by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources. Profiles are presented as a single file for 1989-2016 and as annual compiled datasets beginning in 2017. These data were quality controlled for basic errors and measurements outside of normal factory issued sensor ranges.
