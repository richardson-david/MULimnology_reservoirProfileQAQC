If Git freezes/hangs up in R Studio, you cna force quit RStudio but Git might be locked and you have to unlock it.

Go to the folder for the project, right click on the folder and click 'Git Bash here'

This command line deletes that lock and frees up the program:
	rm -f .git/index.lock

In Git Bash, here are some commands:
Commit all with a message and then push

	git commit -am "commit message" 

	git push

Of course you can ignore the GUI and stick to the command-line Git forever, but if you don't want, a quick jump to the command-line git would solve this problem for now.

The temporary solution that I found is as follows:

Click on the blue-gear icon on the GIT panel, inside RStudio.
Select Shell (a terminal window will pup up!)
Write the add and commit command in the terminal:
{ATTENTION: The following command will commit changes on ALL files! You may want to use what is appropriate for your situation!}

    git add -A && git commit -m 'staging all files'

Now you can go back to the GUI Git, and click on push button. All files that you staged in the terminal window, will be pushed up to your repository.

FINAL suggestion: when adding a ton of new files, R Studio tends to hang up
	First, Git>More>New Terminal
	git add -A
	Then go through commit in GUI like usual, even if it the files are selected there
